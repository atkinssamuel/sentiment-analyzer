# Sentiment Analyzer
In this repository, I build a simple sentiment analysis UI that analyzes the sentiment of a conversation.

# Project Objectives

Develop a system to predict the sentiment of each participant in a conversation using a pre-trained language model and fine-tuning techniques.

### Stack

1. Open-source pre-trained language models which need to be fine-tuned
2. Fine-tune the model using an AWS instance
3. Provide a Dockerfile for deployment
4. Display the functionality of the model through a web interface
    - Users can input the text of a conversation
    - The output will be the sentiments of each participant (positive, neutral, negative)
