",2
"yeah , it is really hard that is the real struggle because right now i do live in holland . but i really do n't socialize much with dutch people and my boyfriend 's english is so good that we just basically speak english all the time . so i have to make a real effort to practice . there is n't as much listening exposure as i want , all i have to do is turn on the tv .  | yeah , reading . there was plenty i can get to read and listen to . god for a speaking there really is no substitute for trying to speak and use the language in a relaxed atmosphere . o i think that is really the challenge for people who live in a country where their target language is n't spoken and for that . gosh , what would i do . if i did n't have people here , probably try to find a club in sweden . they have a really cool system called study circles where it 's not it 's like a course but really you just have a course leader who is there sort of . as a coaching guide and to help out and you do n't get grades and you go just because you want to learn .
